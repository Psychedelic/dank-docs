# Welcome to Dank

Dank is an Open Internet Service on the Internet Computer, that provides cycle and ICP based financial services to users and developers! Here you'll find all developer documentation you will need to get started using Dank, and interacting with the interfaces and features it provides. Dank is built by [Psychedelic](https://psychedelic.ooo), a collective of developers and entrepreneurs creating Internet Computer Open Internet Services from and for the community.

**Important:** Dank is currently in the last stages of development and will be released soon to the Internet Computer. You can join our community to follow -and aid!- it's development.

**[Read our reveal & intro article](https://medium.com/@dank_ois/e7dd8e4c3d25?source=friends_link&sk=91bd9be1283ccf00d115b40ed539c4e1)**, and visit the **Protocol Overview** and **Basic Concepts** sections to learn the basics. Once Dank is fully released -real soon!- we will add all developer, api, and interface sections for anyone to start building and interacting with Dank.

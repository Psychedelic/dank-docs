## Main Products
### Cycles Token (XTC) - Alpha

The Cycles Token (XTC) is a cycles ledger canister that provides users with a “wrapped/tokenized” version of cycles (XTC) that can be held with just a Principal ID (no need for a Cycles Wallet), and that also includes all the same developer features and functions (calls) as the Cycles Wallet (built into the XTC token itself). 

Each Cycles Token (XTC) is backed 1-to-1 with 1 Trillion Cycles **(1 XTC = 1 Trillion Cycles)**, with cycles locked in the canister. Through the XTC canister users & developers can call/perform any traditional trade cycle actions (send, deposit, withdraw, etc.), as well as proxy canister calls funded by cycles in their XTC balance (create canister, proxy calls to canister methods, topping up cycles in calls).

!!! Important

    Dank's Cycles Token (XTC) is an Alpha product and is in active development. During this testing/development period, the Dank core team will have control over the canister's upgradeability and the "stop/halt" feature to facilitate bug and security updates, prevent malicious acts, and grow the Main Dank Canister in features. 
    
    When the project reaches the desired maturity level, it will transition towards a fully community-owned governance system.


### Wrapped ICP (WICP) - Alpha

Wrapped ICP (WICP) is a wrapped version of the IC's native token, ICP. Each WICP will be backed 1:1 with ICP, meaning that 1 WICP will always have the exact same value as 1 ICP. The only difference is that, unlike ICP, WICP uses the DIP20 fungible token standard that is specifically designed to allow for interoperability between dApps and other tokens.

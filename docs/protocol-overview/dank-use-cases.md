# Participant Use Cases

Participating of the Dank ecosystem has several potential use cases depending on the user type, or project that is to leverage the Dank Open Internet Service. Here we review some of the potential use cases Dank might be used for:

- Users
    - Developers
    - Non-developers
- Providers/Apps
    - Wallets
    - Canister Management
    - IC Applications (general) 

## Dank Users

Dank Users, or Principal IDs registered in Dank. These are users in Dank's ecosystem, and can be represented by non-developer users, and developer users.

### Non-developer Users
- Persons navigating the Internet Computer and its applications.
- Can be considered end-users of the network, its apps, and services.
- Benefit from Dank's Ledgers to hold Cycles with their Principal IDs without needing a Canister Cycle Wallet or Account ID.
- By having cycles centralized to their Principal ID, they can also access to seamless onboarding (one-click auth) to IC apps with just their Principal ID and no need to specify separate Cycles Wallet ID.
- Can utilize Dank or Dank providers (like the Plug Wallet) to manage their IC assets via simple UIs.

### Developer Users
- Due to Dank's nature, as a unified cycles environment, developers can use it as their main place for managing their canisters and projects on the Internet Computer.
- Dank Users can represent an entity, service, or project on the Internet Computer, centralizing and linking their assets in a main identity.
- Finance-oriented developers can utilize Dank's built-in finances to build new cycle-based services.
- Dank simplifies interactions between cycles and a developers canisters, which results in speedier and simpler IC development.

## Providers

Applications or service providers that can leverage Dank to provide their functionalities, power their features, or offer simplified experiences for their users.

### Finances / DeFi
- Wallet applications can integrate Dank to allow users to hold cycles with a Principal ID, as well as Dank's seamless onboarding perks for authenticating users and their balances in one step with just a Principal ID. 
- DeFi platforms can plug into abstracted cycle operations via Dank. For example, to easily surface cycle actions in their UI for users.
- Any service can provide cheaper transactions, internal to the Dank Cycles Ledger, or perform out-of-Dank proxied transactions across canisters or other wallets.

### IC Applications (General)
- Integrate Dank to offer seamless logins to users without the need for a separate canister wallet ID to give them in-app access to cycles.
- Can enable users to utilize a single Principal ID as their unique identifier (identity+wallet) across any Dank-integrated app.
- Can enable community-driven funding for their application's canisters, enabling anyone to fund their canisters in a secure manner.
- Can provide in-app cycle actions, integrated via simple API calls.

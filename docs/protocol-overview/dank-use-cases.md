# Participant Use Cases

Participating of the Dank ecosystem has several potential use cases depending on the user type, or project that is to leverage the Dank Open Internet Service. Here we review some of the potential use cases Dank might be used for:

- Users
    - Developers
    - Non-developers
- Providers/Apps
    - Wallets
    - Canister Management
    - IC Applications (general) 

## Dank Users

Dank Users, or Principal IDs registered in Dank. These are users in Dank's ecosystem, and can be represented by non-developer users, and developer users.

### Non-developer Users
- Persons navigating the Internet Computer and its applications.
- Can be considered end-users of the network, its apps, and services.
- Benefit from Dank's Ledgers to hold Cycles & ICP with their Principal IDs without needing a Canister Cycle Wallet or Account ID.
- By having cycles centralized to their Principal ID, they can also access to seamless onboarding (one-click auth) to IC apps with just their Principal ID and no need to specify separate Cycles Wallet ID.
- Can utilize Dank or Dank providers (like the Plug Wallet) to manage their IC assets via simple UIs, including canisters and charging stations linked to their accounts.

### Developer Users
- Due to Dank's nature, as a unified development environment, a set of developers will use them as their main account for managing their canisters and projects on the Internet Computer.
- Dank Users can represent an entity, service, or project on the Internet Computer, centralizing and linking their assets in a main identity.
- Finance-oriented developers can utilize Dank's built-in finances to build new cycles or ICP services.
- Dank's suite of abstracted cycles, ICP, canister, and charging station feature can be leveraged by developers to speed up and simplify IC app development and automate interaction across the core components of any IC app.

## Providers

Applications or service providers that can leverage Dank to provide their functionalities, power their features, or offer simplified experiences for their users.

### Finances / DeFi
- Wallet applications can integrate Dank to allow users to hold cycles/ICP with a Principal ID, as well as Dank's seamless auth/onboarding functionalities. 
- DeFi platforms can plug into abstracted cycle, ICP, NNS token operations via Dank's API. For example, ICP to Cycles swapping, to easily surface them in their UI for users.
- Any service can provide cheaper transactions, internal to the Dank Cycles Ledger, or perform out-of-Dank proxied transactions across canisters or other wallets.

### Canister Management Interfaces
- Can integrate Dank and surface account-specific canister records to surface them easily in-app.
- Can leverage Dank's cycles finances and charging stations to allow users to send cycles or create charging stations via simple UI experiences, and zero or low code.
- Can use Dank's proxied canister calls to deploy, update or configure any canister on the Internet Computer network.
- Can automate charging station cycles refill aspects and configure cycles consumption and distribution per canister.

### IC Applications (General)
- Integrate Dank  to offer seamless logins to users without the need for a separate canister wallet ID to give them in-app access to cycles.
- Can enable community-driven funding for their application's canisters, enabling anyone to fund their canisters in a secure manner.
- Can provide in-app cycles or ICP actions, integrated via simple API calls.
- By utilizing Dank, IC Apps that have user-specific canisters can keep a per-user registry of the user's assigned canisters to surface them automatically in-app or perform operations for the apps functioning.

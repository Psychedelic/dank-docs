# Trademark

Fleek LLC originally conceived the Dank Open Internet Services and is in charge of distributing its open source code and interfaces. The Dank Open Internet Service is fully open source and community-driven; however, this does not provide access to the Dank brand and image trademarks/licenses.

We take the usage of our brand and service trademarks very seriously, as it is our responsibility to ensure all Dank users whether Fleek LLC is the entity behind a service or website; and that the resources, platforms, services, and open source code/software that is shared represents unmodified Dank software.

These trademark policies affect the Dank brand, and associated image, logos, websites, and content. **Want to ask for permission to utilize our branding, or report a misuse? Contact us at hi@dank.ooo**

Dank is a collection of Open Internet Service / protocol on the Internet Computer for cycles (and other assets) based financial services and management. It is composed of different services and/or protocols built on canister architectures. Dank is fully open source, from the protocol and its services' code, to the interfaces that compose it, and is in its totality deployed on the trustless, decentralized, permissionless and autonomous Internet Computer computational blockchain network.

Dank -and its products/services- are provided “as is”, and utilized at your own risk and responsibility without warranties. Despite Dank, its products, and its main interfaces, having been developed by Fleek LLC, the project and protocol is made to become a community-owned and developed protocol, which will run freely on canisters on the self-governed Internet Computer.

Therefore before utilizing Dank, and any of its products and open internet service you should review its documentation carefully to fully understand its functioning and the risks that could entail the usage of products running on an open and autonomous blockchain network (the Internet Computer). After its initial conception and implementation, Dank's products will transition towards a community-developed approach through the release of a governance system.

No individual, entity, developer (internal to the founding team, or from the Dank community), or Dank itself will be considered liable for any damages or claims related to the usage, interaction, or lack of functioning associated with Dank and its services, its interfaces, or websites. This includes loss of profits, assets of any value, or indirect, incidental, direct, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages. The same applies to the usage of the Dank Open Internet Service through third-party interfaces or applications that surface their features. It is your responsibility to manage the risk of your activities and usage on said platforms.
